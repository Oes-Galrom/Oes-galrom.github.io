<p><strong>Oscar Galrom | <em>Corvus</em> and Human Information Modeling
| NSCI 4197</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Organic life forms act as vessels for information to be imprinted and
maintained, though with differing clarity as obfuscated through their
neuroanatomy. Information is hard to store, as entropy tries to reduce
it to static. (Maroney, 2009). The ability to model the world spatially
and temporally is a complex neurological task requiring the perception
and processing of information to be effectively organized. Figuratively,
it is the ability of an animal to build an active model of information
pertaining to experience, and then sequentially organize that
information internally, discerning relevant information between past,
present, and future contexts. The relevant information and the order in
which it is processed work to combat information's natural degradation
in a manner specific to the adaptations of the organism. The uniqueness
of human experience stems from our significant neuroanatomical
progression allowing us the extravagant means to quantify and model the
information presented by reality. The <em>Corvus</em> genus of birds has
neuroanatomical organization that has evolved comparable structures to
humans that allow them to interact with the world with a striking degree
of intent. They are capable of displaying incredible higher-order
behaviors: theory of mind, meta-cognition, and delayed gratification
(Güntürkün and Bugnyar., 2016). Both subjects are capable of the
extremity required to be conscious - namely that our experiences of time
and reality are similar enough that the system under which we organize
time can be represented through a Markov Decision Process (MDP).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>An MDP represents a system in which an entity exists. As described by
a set of states 's' where each state represents a possible configuration
of the system, and a set of actions 'a' representing decisions or
choices that they can make at each state (Smelser and Baltes, 2001).
Actions have “weight” depending on preexisting logic set within the
particular agent. The conditions of an MDP require an agent to discern
reality through temporal order, namely the: past, present, and future.
Previous “states” compose the bulk of past processing, fulfilled in
<em>Corvus</em> and humans through their respective hippocampi. We
experience previous states as memory. The simulation of potential future
states, as well as the ability to interpret the ‘weight’ of the value of
these potential states through reward mediation, is heavily influenced
by the nidopallium and its correlate the pre-frontal cortex. These
structures allow an entity to orient towards the future. The information
is experienced in the organism's subjective present state. The organism
interprets the system through a crossover of its past and future
processing along with immediately available information. In
<em>Corvus</em> species and humans, information crossover can be
observed in the mesopallium and intratelencephalic neurons. In order to
sustain an MDP, <em>Corvus</em> would be required to discern between
information that is temporally relevant to the past, future, and most
importantly present. It would require them to model both the environment
and their own agentic self.</p>
<p>Increased proficiency in system modelling complicates the agent’s
perception of its situation with supplemental information, thus
increasing the pool of both states and actions. In the context of
succeeding in an MDP, spatial-temporal proficiency defines the scope of
information from which the organism can orient its conscious self. An
agent that can incorporate information about the past, present, and
future will be far more successful in navigating a complex MDP. In this
way, information clarity is an advantage in natural selection, as it
improves an animal’s chances of survival. The concept of the MDP is a
machine learning principle. Viewing an organism through the lens of
computational logic eases the complication of transcribing experience
and allows for a model in which to represent the functional architecture
of the neuroanatomy of information management.</p>
<p><strong>Anatomical and Functional Comparisons</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Corvus</em> and human hippocampi are generally considered
homologous, though they have 300 million years of independent evolution
between them. The regions developed to handle fundamentally similar
tasks of memory formation, though the specific organization and
functionality varies. The avian hippocampus can be arranged into three
zones: dorsolateral (DL), dorsomedial (DM), and ventral (V) (Székely
1999). The DL hippocampus projects to the basal ganglia, limbic areas,
lateral septum, and paraxial meso-diencephalic centers. Its vast
effector range associates it with the subiculum of the human
hippocampus, which connects the amygdala, hypothalamus, septum, and
mammillary bodies, facilitating reciprocal stimulation of its regions.
It also sends efferent signals to thalamic and other limbic areas (Fogwe
et al., 2023). The avian V section mirrors Ammon’s horn through
featuring commissural projections crossing opposite sides of the brain,
and the DM section features intrinsic connectivity like the dentate
gyrus. (Székely, 1999). Furthermore, both human and avian hippocampi
have increased dendritic spine density, which correlates with excitatory
transmission, and is indicative of a sensitive system (Uster and
Bonhoeffer, 2001). Crows have a higher spine density than other birds
(Srivastava et al., 2012), and spine formations on dendrites are a
hallmark of excitatory synapses and spatial processing within the
hippocampus. (Mahmmoud et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Functionally, in both humans and birds, the hippocampus is critical
for spatial modeling (Srivastava et al., 2018). The human hippocampus
makes use of spatially responsive cells to transfer spatial information
and form a cognitive map of the physical environment (Herwig &amp;
Kahana, 2018). Known as place and grid cells, they fire in patterns
according to the nearby environment as the organism spatially processes
(Jacobs et al., 2010). Though not specific to the <em>Corvus</em> genus,
the avian hippocampus also generally has spatially responsive cells. In
pigeons, numerous spatial cells have been found including location
cells, path cells, arena-off cells, and pattern cells (Sherry et al.,
2017). The greater observed diversity of cells specialized for spatial
discernment could indicate a difference in their interpretation of
spatial reality.</p>
<p>There is an increase in hippocampal volume and neuron count amongst
birds that frequently cache food, such as <em>Corvus</em> species.
(Krebs, 1990). In humans, it is integral for transforming short-term
memories and associations into long-term storage, influencing
decision-making. Birds have a similar use-case to the hippocampus for
spatial memory, particularly in food caching behaviors, where they
geolocate previously stashed food deposits (Krebs, 1990). Significant
hippocampal development and highly articulated memory behaviors indicate
their ability to interpret and categorize their experience with the
world. The similarity in structure for memory would imply that advanced
birds are highly capable in processing and discerning in their own
experience, potentially to the point of auto-noetic recall - the ability
to re-experience past events. This ability is crucial for higher order
functioning on the basis of carrying a non-degradable ego as a center of
experience (Clayton et al., 2003). In both <em>Corvus</em> and humans,
the hippocampus functionally serves the organisms to be able to interact
with their environment with reference to past states.</p>
<p>Comparative studies across bird species reveal differences in
dopaminergic pathways, similar to the diversity observed in mammals (von
Eugen et al., 2020). Specifically, cognitive capability in birds is
correlated with the diversity of myelinated dopaminergic fibers in the
nidopallium caudolateralis (NCL), with carrion crows exhibiting a
greater variety compared to pigeons and chickens. This complexity in
myelination patterns within the dopaminergic system is analogous to the
advanced dopaminergic regulation observed in primates’ prefrontal cortex
(PFC), suggesting a convergent evolutionary development associated with
cognitive abilities (von Eugen et al., 2020). In both birds and
primates, these brain regions receive dopaminergic innervation from
midbrain areas, integrate information from visual, auditory, and
somatosensory regions, and have projections to motor and limbic systems
(Diekamp et al., 2000). The dopamine system modulates PFC functions in
humans, and a similar modulation is observed in the avian NCL. For
example, when D1 receptor antagonists are introduced to the avian NCL,
it results in decreased performance on visual discrimination tasks
(Diekamp et al., 2000).</p>
<p>The nidopallium is a prominent feature in the telencephalon of
intelligent birds, namely <em>Corvus</em>, and is generally one of the
largest structures within it (Kersten et al., 2022). This region
surrounds the avian striatum-arcopallium seated caudal to the
mesopallium. Unlike mammals, birds lack clear brain region delineations,
instead, these are inferred by gradients of markers like tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH+) (von Eugen et al., 2020). The nidopallium's contact
with the mesopallium is marked by the lamina mesopallialisventralis, and
the NCL is distinguishable by increased TH+ fiber density, subdivided
into medial, ventral, and dorsal regions based on this density (von
Eugen et al., 2020). Functionally, neurons in the NCL perform roles
similar to those of the human PFC, processing sensory and cognitive
information, supporting working memory, and encoding time-based stimulus
associations (Moll &amp; Nieder., 2015). Neurons within both the NCL and
PFC alter firing rates in response to task specifics, serving as
processing centers for discernment (Rainer et al., 1998; Tang et al.,
2022). Interestingly, crows' NCL does not seem to send feedback to the
hippocampus regarding categorization, suggesting a one-way flow of
qualia identification within the NCL (Ditz, 2018). Potentially impeding
their ability to update personal understanding or interpretation of
experience.</p>

<p><strong>Fig 1. 3d reconstruction of carrion crow neuroanatomy
(Kersten et al. 2022)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As centers of working memory the NCL and PFC have the unique ability
to orient towards the future. Humans who experienced damage to the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex had impairment in specifically future
oriented processing (Ciaramelli et al., 2020) There is no analogue for
assessing this affinity in <em>Corvus</em> species directly, but the NCL
is implicated in coding stimulus value, and incorporates information
about stimulus value and delay (Dykes et al., 2018) as so is similarly
at the minimum functionally oriented towards potential states,
fulfilling the MDP function of future processing and weight management
along with the PFC.</p>
<p>The mesopallium in birds serves a transitional role in information
processing, analogous to the intratelencephalic (IT) neurons in the
mammalian neocortex, particularly because it shares transcription
factors with neocortical layers 2, 3, 5, and 6 found in mammals (Briscoe
et al., 2018) and both facilitate complex interconnection in the brain.
IT neurons in mammals facilitate bidirectional communication between the
neocortex and thalamus within cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loops,
integrating information across cortical areas and the striatum (Shepherd
and Yamawaki, 2021), as well as higher-order thalamic nuclei and
subcortical areas through connection with cortical layer 5 (Mease and
Gonzalez, 2021). The fact that they minimally branch while connecting to
such a vast array of regions signifies their importance for information
transmission rather than processing as design is focused on connecting
these distant brain regions (Mease and Gonzalez, 2021).</p>
<p>However, the mesopallium does not directly interact with the striatum
due to the intervening nidopallium, which also separates it from the
olfactory cortex. Instead, the mesopallium appears to have developed to
more assist the nidopallium in processing information. The mesopallium
contains regions that receive thalamic inputs and run reciprocal
connections to the NCL and regions that reciprocally connect the NCL
with other pallial regions (Atoji and Wild, 2011). The mesopallium also
functions for pathway convergence of the output of two pathways stemming
from the visual Wulst region, and the categorial informative tectofugal
pathway. This architectural crossing is the <em>Corvus’s</em>
distribution of information processing implying the MVL as the eminent
center of qualia discernment (Niu et al., 2022).</p>
<p>The IT neurons fulfill the MDP role of the agent itself, interacting
with the system at any particular moment. They are the physical
embodiment of where all the information converges (Tonani et al., 2016),
and the point from which a “present” can be discerned. IT neurons fire
when encoding movement, during processing of information, making
decisions, and when interpreting value of stimulus (Shinotsuka et al.,
2023; Won Bae et al., 2021; Musall et al., 2023; Garcia et al., 2021).
Fundamentally, they fire when an organism does something minimally
consciously significant. Unlike mammals, where similar cell types are
distributed across the neocortical area, avian neuroanatomy has evolved
by grouping similar cells into nuclei resulting in the separation of the
mesopallium into its own major structure of intercommunication (Briscoe
et al. 2018). From a development standpoint, this can be considered a
monolithic approach, loading multiple jobs and functions into a single
entity leading to a snowball effect where the entity is overloaded with
tasks. Under this view, the human method of organization is
significantly more sophisticated, spreading out channels of
communication and processing to avoid performance bottlenecks and
scalability issues that arise from shuffling vast amounts of data across
limited channels (Kalske et al., 2018). Nonetheless, the mesopallium
functions for convergence of the output of two pathways stemming from
the visual Wulst region, and the categorial informative tectofugal
pathway, and so is still anatomically functional in weaving together
varied information (Niu et al., 2022). In pigeons the mesopallium fires
in response to visual discrimination (Anderson et al., 2020), and in
parrots, auditory learning triggers firing (Eda-Fujiwara et al., 2012).
Extrapolating, if <em>Corvus</em> would have an anatomical setback
weakening their MDP agent relative to humans, it certainly appears to be
their mesopallium.</p>
<p><strong>Evolutionary Significance</strong></p>
<p>If existing in a 3-D environment means being subjected to reality
under the passage of time, then an organism with a higher dimensional
understanding of time management would be at great advantage relative to
its information blind competitors. "Self-control" as a model of
behavior, stems from an agent spending energy reducing its own variance
in accordance with a strategy. It is realizing that the self is also a
factor in the environment; it is control of the subjective or objective
self (Miller et al., 2019). The ability of self-control is seen in
<em>Corvus</em> species through delaying food retrieval until necessary,
delaying immediate satiation for the accordance of greater strategy for
survival (Miller et al., 2019). A lack of "self-control" in humans is
highly linked to issues such as behavioral problems, addiction, and
other measures of life success (Miller et al., 2019). In humans and
chimpanzees, general intelligence is also linked with self-control
(Beran &amp; Hopkins 2018).</p>
<p>Self-control is downstream of the scalar of agent strength. The more
advanced, the better the modelling towards self, the better strategy
revolves around optimizing the self, there-in lies the main difference
in our neurology. Unlike most other animals, <em>Corvus</em> species
have evolved to have impressive future and past modelling given their
status as non-human, but the key difference that sets them back in the
MDP is their inferior capability to model the present agent. The
separation of the NCL from the striatum potentially harms the resolution
of their weight discernment and general cognitive organization. For
instance, the fact that birds are generally worse at discerning quality
over quantity (Miller et al., 2018). Additionally, their lack of a truly
integrated anatomical substrate for modelling of the present, like in IT
neurons, may limit their abilities in developing a sense of self or
particularly active consciousness.</p>
<p>The application of machine learning principles to understand these
cognitive processes extricates the relationship between neuroanatomy,
behavior, and the evolutionary adaptation of problem solving in both
humans and crows. The neuroanatomy of <em>Corvus</em> species allows
them to interact with the world from the position of an MDP complete
entity. Allowing them to interact with the environment at a meta level -
exempt from the immediate gain and loss, where the goal isn’t an
immediate response or urge, but rather the ability to make the absolute
best decision available given a context. In the same way that it is
foundational to reaching the “optimal” for an algorithm, it is the
fundamental strategy of cognitive evolution and the “reason” for the
development of a consciously controlled, independently organized,
neurologically capable organism. The trade-off in resources, energy, and
time it takes to reach this point is offset by the amazing capacity to
learn in the moment. This cognitive ability is crucial for predicting
future outcomes based on past experiences while adapting to the current
situation. With a static agent, dyssynchronous environments spell doom,
the animal is condemned to be confined to the loop created by the
interaction of the environment and its singular strategy (Barto et al.,
1989). The ability to learn and adapt within a single lifespan,
bypassing the slower process of genetic evolution, is a significant
evolutionary advantage for both species. Evolution now takes place
within the setting of an individual organism's constantly evolving
interface with reality.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The comparative analysis of human and <em>Corvus</em> neuroanatomy
reveals similarities in their cognitive processing abilities,
particularly in parallel processing of past, present, future, and the
ability to incorporate these dynamically.</p>
<p>The parallel processing afforded through the hippocampus' memory,
NCL's future simulation, and the mesopallium’s facilitation of present
processing collectively gives the <em>Corvus</em> genus a holistic
anatomical toolset to manipulate and interpret multiple temporal
realities at once. This parallel processing allows for advanced
interaction with their environments, evident in their ability to adapt
and manipulate situations to their advantage. This behavioral and
anatomical complexity mirrors human problem-solving skills and brain
architecture, where we interact with our environment, making calculated
decisions based on our observations and experiences, able to summon
forth actions against the environment and update the consequences in
real time while our brain stores and shifts the ideas as needed.</p>
<p>They exhibit novel problem-solving ability due to their architecture
having sufficiently powerful temporal organization to sustain an
interpretation of the world as a sustained Markov decision process.
<em>Corvus</em> and Humans are both anatomically sufficient to afford
all these necessities in unison- namely the sustained reciprocal
processing of agent and environment, modelling and consequences,
organized in temporal context. The comparison reveals a design pattern
to intelligence - the architecture of intelligent macro-organisms
functionally mimics the logic in machine learning. Temporal clarity of
the present moment allows an organism personal agency. The information
we discern as relevant, which constitutes our model of reality, is
limited by the context of the Markov decision process- the world, in
which we have come to evolve.</p>
